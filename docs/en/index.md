# 🌌 BRI DAO Starter

🚀 Welcome to **BRI DAO** — a decentralized research platform dedicated to the study of celestial mechanics, time cycles, and probable future scenarios.  
We bring together diverse predictive disciplines — from planetary cycle dynamics to neural network modeling — for deep analysis of time and decision support.

---

## 🌠 Concept

**BRI DAO** is a collective tool for observing, forecasting, and analyzing cyclical patterns — both in celestial mechanics and socio-economic processes.  
Our goal is to build a living "story engine" that records planetary configurations and events daily, gradually recognizing recurring patterns that influence society, markets, and culture.

---

## 🧠 Participants

We distinguish three main types of participants:

- **Users (Holders)** — read reports and use BRI DAO as a forecasting resource  
- **Researchers** — create forecasts, reports, and models based on data and cycles  
- **Investors** — support DAO development with resources, expertise, and trust

All participants interact with the DAO through the **BRI** token — the core tool for governance, voting, and incentive distribution.

## 💎 Tokens

### **Token Emission**
The total supply of **BHRIGU** tokens is 2.1 billion units.  
Of those, **1,427,516,541 BHRIGU (67.98%)** were burned on the Minter network (including 400 million during migration from TON and Ethereum) as part of reserve backing for the new token on ICP (ICRC-1).

### **BRI** — the main platform token (ICRC-1 standard):
- Governance and voting  
- Access to advanced forecasts  
- Participation in reward distribution

### **ORA** — limited-issue utility token:
- Internal support for DAO infrastructure  
- Operation of prediction modules  
- Calculations within the protocol

🔥 **950,000 ORA** — burned on Minter (as reserve for BRI)  
💼 **50,000 ORA** — retained on Minter (strategic team reserve)
